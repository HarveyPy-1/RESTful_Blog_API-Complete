A complete Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript blog website that enables users log in and out, register new users, 
upload content (pictures, text, etc), create new blog posts, edit only blog posts they've created. 
Blog posts accept comments, all associated with the user. 
I have used my knowledge of advanced Python modules to create pages, define logic on all pages using Jinja 
User passwords are encrypted with industry standard hashing before stored in the database using SQLAlchemy

I think you'll find the site fully fleshed out.
